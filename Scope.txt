                        ## SCOPE OF WORK FOR BACKEND DEVELOPERS

**Product Name:** BLOOD

**Type:** Web Application

**Duration:** One Month

**Project Description:**

BLOOD is a web platform designed to connect blood donors and recipients, bridging the gap in access to life-saving blood transfusions. This platform aims to create a seamless and efficient system for:

* **Donor Registration:**  Allowing individuals to register as potential blood donors, providing their contact information, blood type, and availability.
* **Recipient Request:** Enabling individuals or healthcare institutions to submit requests for blood transfusions, specifying the required blood type, urgency, and location.
* **Matching and Notification:**  Matching donor profiles with recipient requests based on blood type, location, and availability, and notifying both parties via email or SMS.
* **Donation Scheduling:**  Facilitating the scheduling of blood donations between donors and recipients, ensuring smooth coordination and timely delivery.
* **Data Management:**  Maintaining a secure and organized database of donor and recipient profiles, requests, and donation history.

**Backend Responsibilities:**

* **Server-Side Development:**  Build a robust and scalable backend using PHP, Node.js, Python/Django, or another suitable language to handle user authentication, data storage, API endpoints, and data processing.
* **Database Design and Implementation:**  Design and implement a relational database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) or a NoSQL database (MongoDB) to store user data, blood type information, donation requests, and other relevant information.
* **API Development:**  Create RESTful APIs to enable communication between the frontend (web application) and the backend. These APIs will handle user registration, login, blood request submission, matching, notification, and data management functions.
* **Security Implementation:**  Ensure data security and privacy by implementing appropriate authentication, authorization, and encryption measures.
* **Scalability and Performance:**  Design the backend architecture to handle a growing number of users and requests efficiently.
* **Integration with Third-Party Services:**  Consider integrating with external services like SMS gateways or email providers for communication and notifications.
* **Documentation:**  Provide clear and comprehensive documentation of the backend code, database schema, and API endpoints for future maintenance and development.

**Deliverables:**

* **Fully functional backend application with all required API endpoints.**
* **Database schema and data migration scripts.**
* **Comprehensive documentation of the backend code, database, and APIs.**

**Success Criteria:**

* **The backend should be secure, reliable, and scalable.**
* **All API endpoints should be well-documented and function correctly.**
* **The database should be designed to efficiently store and retrieve data.**

**Communication:**

* Regular communication with the frontend development team is essential to ensure seamless integration between the backend and frontend.
* Daily stand-up meetings and weekly progress reports will be used to track progress and address any issues.

**This detailed scope of work provides a clear understanding of the backend development responsibilities for the BLOOD web application. It emphasizes the importance of security, scalability, and efficient data management. By focusing on these key areas, the backend team can contribute to building a successful and impactful platform.**


** the database for the project hase been creted and hosted already see datails below **

$username: "if0_36742666";
$password: "uPUoywvb0W";
$Servername: "185.27.134.165"; 
dbname: "if0_36742666_blood";

** details of login / database access are highly confidential and as such must be handled with care and kept discrate, it must at for any reason be shared with another person without the writen authorization of the author and owner of the project **

**Function of the database**
Having said php my sql will be used, a genaral databasewill be created to handle all the registered users of website 
the enter to the index.html page befor registration or login, upon click to search button in thr become a find a donoe page or 
the join button in the become a donor page or the profile, or on the safe a life today button on the home page(index.html), the user is confirmed registed or not,  if not is directed to he loginpage to login or create account. 

uponsuccess they may procees, the,  if the become donor page is called from any of its buttons the use further details are collected and stored in a new table called donor, (note: the first table is called users and the secound is call donors). if he is a one time donation the after the first donation is met the one time donoer is removed from the table to prevent the name from poping ip upon avaliable donor shearch, but if not a one time documentation then the name is retained in the table.

the database should keep track of the time of last donation so it can calculate the time of next donatio, so a person should not donate more that once within the unsave pariod of danation, the time is calculated based og the gender, abount of blood and age(age is need be), eg a woman may not called up to donate morethe 2pund of blood(**please confirm this with a medical practitional**).

durrint the record creation for a donor, php should some check like the age check, gender check and health check, by requesting for evidence of age, gender and health status " the record will be ccreated within 24 hours after the check are completed and validated by a personel in charge, so the donor's details will be sent to verifivation and if all good the row ceated the donor will be notified in the notificationpage and email.

## id any question please rech out to my whats app and if any adjust me ts will be made i'll let you know
